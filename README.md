# _Programming Language Suggester_

#### _A short survey to suggest programming languages, created February 2020_

#### By _**Stacey S**_

## Description

_This is a survey created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery in order to recommend certain coding languages to people who are unsure of where to start. While coding languages retain a number of similarities, it is common to use multiple within the same set of code and it is still important for users to put some thought into which language(s) they should learn._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a program created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery._
* _You do not need any extra programs to run this file. The only web page will be your survey in the "language-suggester.html" file._
* _Once the form has been filled out once, you may need to refresh the page if you would like to try a different selection of answers. However, hitting the "submit" button to hide your results should count as a "reset" for the form and you can shuffle around answers as you'd like._
* _To clone this repository: click clone/download, open Git Bash, type "git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY", and press enter._

## Known Bugs

_There was a minor bug where the form would only allow you to select one overall answer or where you could select multiple answers within each question. However these should all be fixed with the updated code._

## Technologies Used

_The "neon button" effect was created using a tutorial found on YouTube. I have been unable to recreate the full effect without breaking the existing code. This may be because the code is originally meant as a linked button and not for a form submittal, however I am unsure at the moment._
